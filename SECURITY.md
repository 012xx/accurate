# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security reports are investigated by the project maintainers and resolved within a reasonable timeframe.

To report a security vulnerability, please use GitHub's [private security reporting](https://github.com/cybozu-go/accurate/security/advisories/new). This allows the reporter and maintainers to coordinate the disclosure and fix before public disclosure.

For more information about private security reporting, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for the latest released version of Accurate.

## Embargo Policy

Vulnerability information is kept confidential until a fix is released. If you accidentally disclose information, please contact us immediately.
