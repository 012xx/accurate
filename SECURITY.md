## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities.
All reports are thoroughly investigated by our team and a set of community volunteers in a reasonable timeframe.

To report a vulnerability, submit your vulnerability via the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/cybozu-go/accurate/security/advisories/new).
You can also email the private <neco@cybozu.com> list with the security details of your reports.
